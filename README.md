# block_chain
Need to satisfy these properties:
- Cryptography – Each transaction recorded in a Blockchain is secured through complex cryptographic computations validated by all the stakeholders involved.
- Decentralization – Each member of the Blockchain network has access to the complete database.
- Provenance – The origin of every transaction contained in the Blockchain ledger can be tracked and monitored.
- Immutability – Once a transaction is recorded in a Blockchain, it cannot be deleted. Only through the consent of all parties can the record be altered.
- Anonymity – Each user in the network has an address generated via the system itself – they do not have an identity. This way, the users can maintain their anonymity (particularly required in a public blockchain structure).
- Transparency – Since each member of the Blockchain can access the system and monitor the operations, there’s complete transparency in the process. Altering one block would mean that the whole chain has to be changed, and this is highly unlikely to happen (it requires enormous computing power to overwrite the blockchain network).

- *probably should write this in GO using channels*
- creating the network
- broadcasting blocks and validating them
- select and implement a consensus algo
